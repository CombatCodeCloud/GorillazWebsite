# GorillazWebsite
A Gorillaz website made with HTML and CSS. Made this because I needed to learn how to make cool JS stuff look pretty. Index and tours were made following along with tutorials, and for the music page I did my own thing. I'm also not going to make a real store because I already have a JS side project.

Step one: Open index.html
Step two: Bliss.

Let me know if anything goes wrong
